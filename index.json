A novel framework that has emerged from such advancements is the just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), which aims to suggest the right support to the individuals when their needs arise. The micro-randomized trial (MRT) design has been proposed recently to test the proximal effects of these JITAIs. However, the extant MRT framework only considers components with a fixed number of categories added at the beginning of the study. We propose a flexible MRT (FlexiMRT) design which allows addition of more categories to the components during the study. The proposed design is motivated by collaboration on the DIAMANTE study, which learns to deliver text messages to encourage physical activity among the patients with diabetes and depression. We developed a new test statistic and the corresponding sample size calculator for the FlexiMRT using an approach similar to the generalized estimating equation for longitudinal data. Simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the sample size calculators and an R shiny application for the calculators was developed.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A Flexible Micro-Randomized Trial Design and Sample Size Considerations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoxi Yan","David M.Dunne","Samuel G.Impey","Brian Cunniffe","Carmen E.Lefevre","Rodrigo Mazorra","James P.

Despite this approach being accepted in the athletic populations, athletes do not systematically follow the guidelines. Digital environments appear to allow nutritionists to deliver this intervention at scale, reducing expensive human coaching time. Yet, digitally delivered dietary behavior change interventions for athletes and the coaching strategy to support them are still novel concepts within sports nutrition. Methods/design We aim to recruit 900 athletes across the UK. 500 athletes will be recruited to test the feasibility of a novel menu planner mobile application with coaching for 6 weeks. 250 athletes with pre-existing nutritionist support will also be recruited as control. We will then conduct a 4-week pilot sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) with an additional 150 athletes. In the SMART, athletes will be given the application and additional coaching according to their engagement responses. The primary outcomes are the mobile application and coach uptake, retention, engagement, and success in attaining carbohydrate periodization behavior. Secondary outcomes are changes in goal, weight, carbohydrate periodization self-efficacy, and beliefs about consequences. Due to the high attrition nature of digital interventions, all quantitative analyses will be carried out based on both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol principles. Discussion This study will be the first to investigate improving carbohydrate periodization using a digital approach and tailored coaching strategies under this context. Foundational evidence from this study will provide insights into the feasibility of the digital approach.","tags":[""],"title":"A pilot sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) protocol for developing an adaptive coaching intervention for athletes to improve carbohydrate periodization behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Soye Shin","Bibhas Chakraborty","Xiaoxi Yan","Rob M van Dam","Eric A Finkelstein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1645574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645574400,"objectID":"4179f4a86077a4538c074b3d161abdd5","permalink":"https://xiaoxi-yan.github.io/publication/shopping-behaviour/","publishdate":"2022-02-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shopping-behaviour/","section":"publication","summary":"\nBackground Several intervention strategies have been shown to improve diet quality. However, there is limited evidence on the increase in effectiveness that may be achieved through select combinations of these strategies. Purpose This study aimed to identify an effective multicomponent intervention to improve diet quality of a grocery basket by applying a Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework and testing various combinations of four promising strategies using a fully functional web-based grocery store: (i) front-of-pack food labels and real-time feedback of the healthiness of the shoppers’ grocery basket, (ii) a tax, (iii) ordering products by a nutritional quality score, and (iv) healthier substitute offers. Methods We conducted a hypothetical shopping study (N = 756) with a randomized full factorial design (16 conditions) to estimate main and interaction effects of the four interventions. Results The “food labels \u0026 real-time feedback” and “ordering” strategies had significantly positive main effects on overall diet quality of the shopping basket (both at p \u003c .001). We found no effects on diet quality for the “tax” and “healthier substitute offers.” None of the two-way interaction effects for different strategies on overall diet quality and nutrients were significant. Conclusions Having “food labels \u0026 real-time feedback” and “ordering” simultaneously seemed to be more effective at improving diet quality, compared to having only one of these interventions. These results suggest that a combination of food labels with real-time feedback and ordering interventions can be part of a promising multicomponent strategy to improve diet quality in online shopping platforms.

Design Three-arm randomized controlled trial. Setting Stroke units of 2 Singapore tertiary hospitals.\nParticipants Singaporeans or permanent residents 21 years or older who were diagnosed as having stroke and were discharged home with physician's recommendation to continue outpatient rehabilitation (N=266). Interventions A Transportation Incentives arm (T), which provides free transportation services, a Transportation \u0026 Sessions Incentives arm (T\u0026S), offering free transportation and prescribed stroke rehabilitation sessions, and a control arm, Education (E), consisting of a stroke rehabilitation educational program. Main Outcome Measures The primary study outcome was uptake of outpatient rehabilitation services (ORS) among patients poststroke and key predefined secondary outcomes being number of sessions attended and adherence to prescribed sessions. Results Uptake rate of ORS was 73.0% for E (confidence interval [CI]: 63.8%-82.3%), 81.8% for T (CI: 73.8%-89.8%), and 84.3% for T\u0026S (CI: 76.7%-91.8%). Differences of T and T\u0026S vs E were not statistically significant (P=.22 and P=.10, respectively). However, average number of rehabilitation sessions attended were significantly higher in both intervention arms; 5.50±7.65 for T and 7.51±9.52 for T\u0026S vs 3.26±4.22 for control arm (E) (T vs E: P=.017; T\u0026S vs E: P\u003c.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that persistence was higher for T\u0026S compared with E (P=.029). Conclusions This study has demonstrated a possibility in increasing the uptake of and persistence to stroke ORS with free transportation and sessions. Incentivizing survivors of stroke to take up ORS is a new strategy worthy of further exploration for future policy change in financing ORS or other long-term care services.","tags":[""],"title":"Incentives for Uptake of and Adherence to Outpatient Stroke Rehabilitation Services: A 3-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoxi Yan","David B.

Methods Microsimulation models were created in R using a synthetic sample based on primary data from 63 subjects enrolled in a pilot study of a smartphone application (App), Diabetes Pal compared to a nurse-based telemedicine strategy (Nurse). For comparability, the SMART and an RCT design were constructed to allow comparison of four (embedded) adaptive interventions (AIs). Results In the base case scenario, the SMART has similar overall mean expected HbA1c and cost per subject compared with RCT, for sample size of n = 100 over 10,000 simulations. SMART has lower (better) standard deviations of the mean expected HbA1c per AI, and higher efficiency of choosing the correct AI across various sample sizes. The differences between SMART and RCT become apparent as sample size decreases. For both trial designs, the threshold value at which a subject was deemed to have been responsive at an intermediate point in the trial had an optimal choice (i.e., the sensitivity curve had a U-shape). SMART design dominates the RCT, in the overall mean HbA1c (lower value) when the threshold value is close to optimal. Conclusions SMART is suited to evaluating the efficacy of different sequences of treatment options, in addition to the advantage of providing information on optimal treatment sequences.","tags":[""],"title":"Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to identify optimal sequences of telemedicine interventions for improving initiation of insulin therapy: A simulation study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoxi Yan","Palash Ghosh","Bibhas Chakraborty"],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the link: https://xiaoxi-yan.shinyapps.io/prec-smart-ss/ for a precision-based sample size calculator for different SMART designs.

Though comorbidity increases the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality, most clinical interventions target these diseases separately. Increasing physical activity might be effective to simultaneously lower depressive symptoms and improve glycaemic control. Self-management apps are a cost-effective, scalable and easy access treatment to increase physical activity. However, cutting-edge technological applications often do not reach vulnerable populations and are not tailored to an individual’s behaviour and characteristics. Tailoring of interventions using machine learning methods likely increases the effectiveness of the intervention. Methods and analysis In a three-arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the effect of a text-messaging smartphone application to encourage physical activity in low-income ethnic minority patients with comorbid diabetes and depression. The adaptive intervention group receives messages chosen from different messaging banks by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The uniform random intervention group receives the same messages, but chosen from the messaging banks with equal probabilities. The control group receives a weekly mood message. We aim to recruit 276 adults from primary care clinics aged 18–75 years who have been diagnosed with current diabetes and show elevated depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale-8 (PHQ-8) \u003e5). We will compare passively collected daily step counts, self-report PHQ-8 and most recent haemoglobin A1c from medical records at baseline and at intervention completion at 6-month follow-up. Ethics and dissemination The Institutional Review Board at the University of California San Francisco approved this study (IRB 17-22608). We plan to submit manuscripts describing our user-designed methods and testing of the adaptive learning algorithm and will submit the results of the trial for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at (inter)-national scientific meetings.
